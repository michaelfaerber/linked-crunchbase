            "description": "Facebook is an online social networking service that allows its users to connect with friends and family as well as make new connections. It provides its users with the ability to create a profile, update information, add images, send friend requests, and accept requests from other users. Its features include status update, photo tagging and sharing, and more.\r\n\r\n\r\nFacebook’s profile structure includes a timeline, information related to the user, images of the user, images added by friends of the user, notes, pages, groups, and more. It enables its users to create pages related to entertainment, sports, business, finance, preferences, hobbies, culture, religion, causes, organizations, and a number of other categories. It also enables its users to join or create groups related to a vast number of categories.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith millions of more users, [Friendster](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/friendster) attempted to acquire the company for $10 million in mid-2004. Facebook turned down the offer and subsequently received $12.7 million in funding from [Accel Partners](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/accel-partners) at a valuation of around $100 million. Facebook continued to grow opening up to high school students in September 2005 and adding a photo sharing feature the next month. The next spring, Facebook received $25 million in funding from [Greylock Partners](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/greylock) and [Meritech Capital](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/meritech-capital-partners) as well as previous investors [Accel Partners](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/accel-partners) and [Peter Thiel](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/peter-thiel). The pre-money valuation for this deal was about $525 million. Facebook subsequently opened up to work networks eventually amassing over 20,000 work networks. Finally in September 2006, Facebook was opened to anyone with an email address.\r\n\r\n\r\nFacebook continued to receive funding most notably in January 2011 receiving $1.5 billion and valuing the company at $50 billion. A year later in February 2012, Facebook announced that it was filing for its long-anticipated initial public offering. The company went public on May 18, 2012 opening in [NASDAQ](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nasdaq-private-market) with shares trading at $42.05.\r\n\r\n\r\nFacebook announced positive numbers in February 2012 upon filing for its IPO. As of July 2013 over 1.15 billion users have logged into Facebook every month and 669 million users daily. Mobile users now make up half of Facebook’s user base with 819 million monthly actives. Facebook is one of the most trafficked sites in the United States. Additionally, Facebook is the top photo sharing site with 250 million photos uploaded per day.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe company has strategic partnership with AXA Group to develop marketing and commercial collaboration in the digital, social, and mobile sphere.\r\n\r\n\r\nFacebook is currently the owner of many applications and services such as Pagemodo Pagebuilder, [RSS Graffiti](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/rss-graffiti), [Huddle](http://www.crunchbase.com/product/huddle), and more. It is the world’s largest social network with over 1.32 billion monthly active users.\r\n\r\n\r\nFacebook was founded by [Mark Zuckerberg](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/mark-zuckerberg), [Eduardo Saverin](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/eduardo-saverin), [Andrew McCollum](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/andrew-mccollum), [Dustin Moskovitz](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/dustin-moskovitz), and [Chris Hughes](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/chris-hughes) on February 4, 2004 in Menlo Park, California.",

He leads the design of Facebook's service and development of its core technology and infrastructure. Mark studied computer science at Harvard University before moving the company to Palo Alto, California.\r\n\r\nEarlier in life, Zuckerberg developed a music recommendation system called Synapse and a peer-to-peer client called Wirehog. However, he abandoned both to pursue new projects.\r\n\r\nZuckerberg attended Harvard University and studied computer science before founding Facebook.\r\n\r\nWhile at Harvard, Zuckerberg created Facemash, a website that compared students' dorm photos side-by-side in a fashion similar to HOT or NOT. Harvard administration was not amused, and Zuckerberg faced subsequent disciplinary action. Less than three months later, he launched Facebook.\r\n\r\nIn September 2010, Zuckerberg donated $100 million to the Newark Public School System to help renovate and revamp the system.\r\n\r\nZuckerberg won the 2007 Crunchie Award for 'Best Startup CEO.' He was the Time Magazine 2010 Person Of The Year. He also won the 2012 Crunchie Award for CEO of the year.",

                            "description": "MySpace is one of the world's largest social networks, with about 125 million users. Originally inspired by [Friendster](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/friendster), MySpace quickly grew to become the world's largest social network, before being overtaken by [Facebook](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/facebook). User pages are highly customizable and support integration with widgets such as [Slide](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/slide) or [YouTube](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/youtube). MySpace provides users with a way to connect around content and culture. \r\n\r\nMySpace was started as a side project of the internet marketing company eUniverse (now called [Intermix Media](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/intermixmedia)) in August 2003. [Brad Greenspan](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/brad-greenspan), then founder and CEO of eUniverse oversaw the project, which was also led by [Chris DeWolfe](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/chris-dewolfe) (later CEO), [Josh Berman](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/josh-berman), and [Tom Anderson](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/tom-anderson) (soon to be President). It officially launched in January 2004.\r\n\r\nBy February 2004, MySpace reached 1 million registered users. By November 2004, that number had reached 5 million. In July, 2005 [News Corporation](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/newscorporation) bought eUniverse (renaming it [Intermix Media](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/intermixmedia)) for $580 M, of which approximately $327 M was the valuation of MySpace. At this time, the site had 20 million registered users. In mid 2007, [News Corporation](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/newscorporation) contemplated selling 25% of MySpace stock to [Yahoo!](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/yahoo) in a deal that would have valued the site at $12 B, though this never went through. \r\n\r\nAfter being acquired, MySpace's revenues grew rapidly, as [News Corporation](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/newscorporation) pursued lucrative advertising deals. In August 2006, [Google](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/google) made a $900 M agreement to provide search and advertising directly on the MySpace site, which is set to expire in June 2010.\r\n\r\nIn mid 2008, MySpace participated in a major site redesign. Throughout its history, critics have often cited the chaotic and disorganized interface as a severe drawback to usability of the site. This redesign made the main page more streamlined and clean.\r\n\r\nIn late 2006, [Universal Music Group](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/universal-music-group) sued MySpace for millions in damages from copyright infringement. This suit was settled in mid 2008 by the launch of [MySpace Music](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/myspace-music), a site where users can listen to streaming songs from all sorts of artists. To supplement this venture, MySpace acquired [iLike](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/ilike) in mid 2009. MySpace had previously also launched a record label in 2005 and musicians such as Lily Allen and Sean Kingston were first discovered through MySpace.\r\n\r\nIn mid 2007, MySpace acquired [PhotoBucket](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/photobucket) for $250 M in cash, plus an additional $50 M earn-out. By late 2009, [News Corporation](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/newscorporation) sold a 2/3 stake in [Photobucket](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/photobucket) to a group of investors valuing the company at $60 M, over 80% less than the acquisition price.\r\n\r\nSince 2008, user growth has stagnated and page views and other metrics have fallen. In April 2009, longtime CEO and co-founder [Chris DeWolfe](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/chris-dewolfe) was replaced by [Owen Van Natta](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/owen-van-natta), in a publicized firing. President and head of product, [Tom Anderson](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/tom-anderson), was kept on, but in a different position. Two months following this, MySpace announced it was laying off 30% of its workforce amounting to 420 people.\r\n\r\nIn June 2011, Myspace was acquired by Specific Media for a [reported US$35 million](http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/29/myspace-goes-to-specific-media-for-35m-ceo-is-out-press-release/). Justin Timberlake also took ownership in this acquisition and will play a strong role in Myspace's future strategy and creative direction.",

Half the installation time!!\r\n\r\nThe Easy2Install switch and outlet system is the Professional and Do It Yourself solution.\r\nThe system consists of combined face plate and switch or outlet units which include prewire connections\r\nto the switches by connector rail and standard terminal connection plugs. The Easy2Install electrical\r\nconnection system is all incorporated into the faceplate, covered for safety and labeled for the easy\r\ninstall in minutes. Wiring a home or room with the Easy2Install unit is as easy as it gets for the\r\nbeginners and professionals and most important you reduce install time. The faceplate Includes an\r\neasy peel off, paint mask. The system is manufactured of quality fire retardant materials\r\nand components, all standard to the industry.\r\n\r\nThe pressure on electrical contractors today to be competitive and faster on the job with quicker completion dates is standard in the industry today. Most electrical contractors are being forced to pre-build the back box and wire connections ( top picture ) in the back of their warehouses across America. Then they ship to the job site to help with reaching ever shortening deadlines for project completion. The problem is their still spending excessive man hours to pre-build the back box in the back of the warehouse and possibly shipping twice.\r\n\r\nTherefor it's costing more money for the 2 step process and then they still have to install the switches and receptacles in a fast paced environment.\r\n\r\nThat's were Easy2Install, LLC helps the electrical contractor save time/steps by decreasing the installation process. Our all in 1 pre-assembled multi combination switch system is prebuilt at the factory and is delivered as a 1 piece unit that only requires attaching the wire circuits and fastening directly to the back box. The face plate, switches, receptacles, jumpers and protective backing with screw in terminals are pre-assembled at the factory ( looking for manufacturing investors ). We also include an easy peel off paint mask to keep our switches clean during painting.\r\n\r\nWe understand change takes time but TIME IS MONEY! So, that brings us to the million dollar question. 50 years with no new mousetrap like top photo or new time saving mousetrap like Easy2Install's all in 1 pre-assembled switch system. You be the judge.\r\n\r\nUL classify's as ( New and Innovative )! Because the switches are already UL approved, we believe UL certification is inevitable for our products.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and support!",

The X1, a small personal cloud device facilitates file storage and collaboration, building relationships, and e-commerce -- by acting together with other X1 devices powers a community-built independent network.\r\n\r\nThe Personal Exchange Network facilitates three types of content exchanges:\r\n\r\n- File Exchange – enables Pixeom users to store and share files with built-in synchronization and commenting for collaboration, as well as versioning for convenient recovery. \r\n\r\n- Club Exchange – provides Pixeom users the ability to create interactive discussion boards and build social communities around topics of interest, or allow businesses to foster communication with customers and partners.\r\n\r\n- Market Exchange – allows Pixeom users to create interactive virtual stores or list individual items for sale via the network, without having to pay listing fees or forfeit profits due to excessive commissions charged by hosting service providers.\r\n\r\nThe Pixeom box itself can be placed anywhere and utilizes remarkably little power. All data is encrypted with secure customizable keys, preventing unauthorized access. Owners of a Pixeom X1 device can easily upload, store, post, and share data from anywhere without using a third-party cloud or hosting service provider, and without being subject to storage limits, usage restrictions, incremental fees, or the potential for security breaches. An X1 can be linked to another owned X1 device for added capacity or redundancy, as well as be deployed at multiple locations to guard against network failures, making it ideal for small business users as well as the individual consumer.\r\n\r\nThe Pixeom X1 is currently available for $100 via the [Pixeom Kickstarter campaign page](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pixeom/pixeom-the-personal-exchange-device) before the general availability in Q2, 2014.",

                                        "description": "Facebook is an online social networking service that allows its users to connect with friends and family as well as make new connections. It provides its users with the ability to create a profile, update information, add images, send friend requests, and accept requests from other users. Its features include status update, photo tagging and sharing, and more.\r\n\r\n\r\nFacebook’s profile structure includes a timeline, information related to the user, images of the user, images added by friends of the user, notes, pages, groups, and more. It enables its users to create pages related to entertainment, sports, business, finance, preferences, hobbies, culture, religion, causes, organizations, and a number of other categories. It also enables its users to join or create groups related to a vast number of categories.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith millions of more users, [Friendster](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/friendster) attempted to acquire the company for $10 million in mid-2004. Facebook turned down the offer and subsequently received $12.7 million in funding from [Accel Partners](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/accel-partners) at a valuation of around $100 million. Facebook continued to grow opening up to high school students in September 2005 and adding a photo sharing feature the next month. The next spring, Facebook received $25 million in funding from [Greylock Partners](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/greylock) and [Meritech Capital](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/meritech-capital-partners) as well as previous investors [Accel Partners](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/accel-partners) and [Peter Thiel](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/peter-thiel). The pre-money valuation for this deal was about $525 million. Facebook subsequently opened up to work networks eventually amassing over 20,000 work networks. Finally in September 2006, Facebook was opened to anyone with an email address.\r\n\r\n\r\nFacebook continued to receive funding most notably in January 2011 receiving $1.5 billion and valuing the company at $50 billion. A year later in February 2012, Facebook announced that it was filing for its long-anticipated initial public offering. The company went public on May 18, 2012 opening in [NASDAQ](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nasdaq-private-market) with shares trading at $42.05.\r\n\r\n\r\nFacebook announced positive numbers in February 2012 upon filing for its IPO. As of July 2013 over 1.15 billion users have logged into Facebook every month and 669 million users daily. Mobile users now make up half of Facebook’s user base with 819 million monthly actives. Facebook is one of the most trafficked sites in the United States. Additionally, Facebook is the top photo sharing site with 250 million photos uploaded per day.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe company has strategic partnership with AXA Group to develop marketing and commercial collaboration in the digital, social, and mobile sphere.\r\n\r\n\r\nFacebook is currently the owner of many applications and services such as Pagemodo Pagebuilder, [RSS Graffiti](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/rss-graffiti), [Huddle](http://www.crunchbase.com/product/huddle), and more. It is the world’s largest social network with over 1.32 billion monthly active users.\r\n\r\n\r\nFacebook was founded by [Mark Zuckerberg](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/mark-zuckerberg), [Eduardo Saverin](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/eduardo-saverin), [Andrew McCollum](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/andrew-mccollum), [Dustin Moskovitz](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/dustin-moskovitz), and [Chris Hughes](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/chris-hughes) on February 4, 2004 in Menlo Park, California.",

It provides its users with the ability to create a profile, update information, add images, send friend requests, and accept requests from other users. Its features include status update, photo tagging and sharing, and more.\r\n\r\n\r\nFacebook’s profile structure includes a timeline, information related to the user, images of the user, images added by friends of the user, notes, pages, groups, and more. It enables its users to create pages related to entertainment, sports, business, finance, preferences, hobbies, culture, religion, causes, organizations, and a number of other categories. It also enables its users to join or create groups related to a vast number of categories.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith millions of more users, [Friendster](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/friendster) attempted to acquire the company for $10 million in mid-2004. Facebook turned down the offer and subsequently received $12.7 million in funding from [Accel Partners](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/accel-partners) at a valuation of around $100 million. Facebook continued to grow opening up to high school students in September 2005 and adding a photo sharing feature the next month. The next spring, Facebook received $25 million in funding from [Greylock Partners](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/greylock) and [Meritech Capital](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/meritech-capital-partners) as well as previous investors [Accel Partners](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/accel-partners) and [Peter Thiel](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/peter-thiel). The pre-money valuation for this deal was about $525 million. Facebook subsequently opened up to work networks eventually amassing over 20,000 work networks. Finally in September 2006, Facebook was opened to anyone with an email address.\r\n\r\n\r\nFacebook continued to receive funding most notably in January 2011 receiving $1.5 billion and valuing the company at $50 billion. A year later in February 2012, Facebook announced that it was filing for its long-anticipated initial public offering. The company went public on May 18, 2012 opening in [NASDAQ](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nasdaq-private-market) with shares trading at $42.05.\r\n\r\n\r\nFacebook announced positive numbers in February 2012 upon filing for its IPO. As of July 2013 over 1.15 billion users have logged into Facebook every month and 669 million users daily. Mobile users now make up half of Facebook’s user base with 819 million monthly actives. Facebook is one of the most trafficked sites in the United States. Additionally, Facebook is the top photo sharing site with 250 million photos uploaded per day.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe company has strategic partnership with AXA Group to develop marketing and commercial collaboration in the digital, social, and mobile sphere.\r\n\r\n\r\nFacebook is currently the owner of many applications and services such as Pagemodo Pagebuilder, [RSS Graffiti](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/rss-graffiti), [Huddle](http://www.crunchbase.com/product/huddle), and more.

                                        "description": "Facebook is an online social networking service that allows its users to connect with friends and family as well as make new connections. It provides its users with the ability to create a profile, update information, add images, send friend requests, and accept requests from other users. Its features include status update, photo tagging and sharing, and more.\r\n\r\n\r\nFacebook’s profile structure includes a timeline, information related to the user, images of the user, images added by friends of the user, notes, pages, groups, and more. It enables its users to create pages related to entertainment, sports, business, finance, preferences, hobbies, culture, religion, causes, organizations, and a number of other categories. It also enables its users to join or create groups related to a vast number of categories.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith millions of more users, [Friendster](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/friendster) attempted to acquire the company for $10 million in mid-2004. Facebook turned down the offer and subsequently received $12.7 million in funding from [Accel Partners](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/accel-partners) at a valuation of around $100 million. Facebook continued to grow opening up to high school students in September 2005 and adding a photo sharing feature the next month. The next spring, Facebook received $25 million in funding from [Greylock Partners](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/greylock) and [Meritech Capital](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/meritech-capital-partners) as well as previous investors [Accel Partners](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/accel-partners) and [Peter Thiel](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/peter-thiel). The pre-money valuation for this deal was about $525 million. Facebook subsequently opened up to work networks eventually amassing over 20,000 work networks. Finally in September 2006, Facebook was opened to anyone with an email address.\r\n\r\n\r\nFacebook continued to receive funding most notably in January 2011 receiving $1.5 billion and valuing the company at $50 billion. A year later in February 2012, Facebook announced that it was filing for its long-anticipated initial public offering. The company went public on May 18, 2012 opening in [NASDAQ](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nasdaq-private-market) with shares trading at $42.05.\r\n\r\n\r\nFacebook announced positive numbers in February 2012 upon filing for its IPO. As of July 2013 over 1.15 billion users have logged into Facebook every month and 669 million users daily. Mobile users now make up half of Facebook’s user base with 819 million monthly actives. Facebook is one of the most trafficked sites in the United States. Additionally, Facebook is the top photo sharing site with 250 million photos uploaded per day.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe company has strategic partnership with AXA Group to develop marketing and commercial collaboration in the digital, social, and mobile sphere.\r\n\r\n\r\nFacebook is currently the owner of many applications and services such as Pagemodo Pagebuilder, [RSS Graffiti](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/rss-graffiti), [Huddle](http://www.crunchbase.com/product/huddle), and more. It is the world’s largest social network with over 1.32 billion monthly active users.\r\n\r\n\r\nFacebook was founded by [Mark Zuckerberg](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/mark-zuckerberg), [Eduardo Saverin](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/eduardo-saverin), [Andrew McCollum](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/andrew-mccollum), [Dustin Moskovitz](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/dustin-moskovitz), and [Chris Hughes](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/chris-hughes) on February 4, 2004 in Menlo Park, California.",

                                    "description": "Facebook is an online social networking service that allows its users to connect with friends and family as well as make new connections. It provides its users with the ability to create a profile, update information, add images, send friend requests, and accept requests from other users. Its features include status update, photo tagging and sharing, and more.\r\n\r\n\r\nFacebook’s profile structure includes a timeline, information related to the user, images of the user, images added by friends of the user, notes, pages, groups, and more. It enables its users to create pages related to entertainment, sports, business, finance, preferences, hobbies, culture, religion, causes, organizations, and a number of other categories. It also enables its users to join or create groups related to a vast number of categories.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith millions of more users, [Friendster](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/friendster) attempted to acquire the company for $10 million in mid-2004. Facebook turned down the offer and subsequently received $12.7 million in funding from [Accel Partners](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/accel-partners) at a valuation of around $100 million. Facebook continued to grow opening up to high school students in September 2005 and adding a photo sharing feature the next month. The next spring, Facebook received $25 million in funding from [Greylock Partners](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/greylock) and [Meritech Capital](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/meritech-capital-partners) as well as previous investors [Accel Partners](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/accel-partners) and [Peter Thiel](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/peter-thiel). The pre-money valuation for this deal was about $525 million. Facebook subsequently opened up to work networks eventually amassing over 20,000 work networks. Finally in September 2006, Facebook was opened to anyone with an email address.\r\n\r\n\r\nFacebook continued to receive funding most notably in January 2011 receiving $1.5 billion and valuing the company at $50 billion. A year later in February 2012, Facebook announced that it was filing for its long-anticipated initial public offering. The company went public on May 18, 2012 opening in [NASDAQ](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nasdaq-private-market) with shares trading at $42.05.\r\n\r\n\r\nFacebook announced positive numbers in February 2012 upon filing for its IPO. As of July 2013 over 1.15 billion users have logged into Facebook every month and 669 million users daily. Mobile users now make up half of Facebook’s user base with 819 million monthly actives. Facebook is one of the most trafficked sites in the United States. Additionally, Facebook is the top photo sharing site with 250 million photos uploaded per day.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe company has strategic partnership with AXA Group to develop marketing and commercial collaboration in the digital, social, and mobile sphere.\r\n\r\n\r\nFacebook is currently the owner of many applications and services such as Pagemodo Pagebuilder, [RSS Graffiti](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/rss-graffiti), [Huddle](http://www.crunchbase.com/product/huddle), and more.

The pre-money valuation for this deal was about $525 million. Facebook subsequently opened up to work networks eventually amassing over 20,000 work networks. Finally in September 2006, Facebook was opened to anyone with an email address.\r\n\r\n\r\nFacebook continued to receive funding most notably in January 2011 receiving $1.5 billion and valuing the company at $50 billion. A year later in February 2012, Facebook announced that it was filing for its long-anticipated initial public offering.

They also created \"the iPhone PSD\", the first popular Photoshop design tool for creating iPhone interfaces.\r\n\r\nAside from creating great digital experiences for clients like Virgin Mobile, Bell, AIR MILES & Corcoran they create self-funded software too. Some of their products include Image Spark (imgspark.com): An image bookmarking service that lets uses save images from anywhere on the Web and organize them in Moodboards.\r\n\r\nTheir second forthcoming product is called TweetMag. It uses Twitter usernames, hashtags and lists to curate a feed of articles. It only uses tweets that contain links and ignores those that don't. When it finds a link, it grabs the headline, an abstract and embeds any associated media (images & videos) into the feed. Essentially, it becomes a feed of articles prioritized by what's being tweeted about most. It doesn't require users to have a twitter account since they can simply search hashtags or view common topics like technology or sports.",

It provides its users with the ability to create a profile, update information, add images, send friend requests, and accept requests from other users. Its features include status update, photo tagging and sharing, and more.\r\n\r\n\r\nFacebook’s profile structure includes a timeline, information related to the user, images of the user, images added by friends of the user, notes, pages, groups, and more. It enables its users to create pages related to entertainment, sports, business, finance, preferences, hobbies, culture, religion, causes, organizations, and a number of other categories. It also enables its users to join or create groups related to a vast number of categories.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith millions of more users, [Friendster](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/friendster) attempted to acquire the company for $10 million in mid-2004. Facebook turned down the offer and subsequently received $12.7 million in funding from [Accel Partners](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/accel-partners) at a valuation of around $100 million. Facebook continued to grow opening up to high school students in September 2005 and adding a photo sharing feature the next month. The next spring, Facebook received $25 million in funding from [Greylock Partners](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/greylock) and [Meritech Capital](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/meritech-capital-partners) as well as previous investors [Accel Partners](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/accel-partners) and [Peter Thiel](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/peter-thiel). The pre-money valuation for this deal was about $525 million. Facebook subsequently opened up to work networks eventually amassing over 20,000 work networks. Finally in September 2006, Facebook was opened to anyone with an email address.\r\n\r\n\r\nFacebook continued to receive funding most notably in January 2011 receiving $1.5 billion and valuing the company at $50 billion. A year later in February 2012, Facebook announced that it was filing for its long-anticipated initial public offering. The company went public on May 18, 2012 opening in [NASDAQ](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nasdaq-private-market) with shares trading at $42.05.\r\n\r\n\r\nFacebook announced positive numbers in February 2012 upon filing for its IPO. As of July 2013 over 1.15 billion users have logged into Facebook every month and 669 million users daily. Mobile users now make up half of Facebook’s user base with 819 million monthly actives. Facebook is one of the most trafficked sites in the United States. Additionally, Facebook is the top photo sharing site with 250 million photos uploaded per day.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe company has strategic partnership with AXA Group to develop marketing and commercial collaboration in the digital, social, and mobile sphere.\r\n\r\n\r\nFacebook is currently the owner of many applications and services such as Pagemodo Pagebuilder, [RSS Graffiti](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/rss-graffiti), [Huddle](http://www.crunchbase.com/product/huddle), and more. It is the world’s largest social network with over 1.32 billion monthly active users.\r\n\r\n\r\nFacebook was founded by [Mark Zuckerberg](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/mark-zuckerberg), [Eduardo Saverin](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/eduardo-saverin), [Andrew McCollum](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/andrew-mccollum), [Dustin Moskovitz](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/dustin-moskovitz), and [Chris Hughes](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/chris-hughes) on February 4, 2004 in Menlo Park, California.",

                                    "description": "Facebook is an online social networking service that allows its users to connect with friends and family as well as make new connections. It provides its users with the ability to create a profile, update information, add images, send friend requests, and accept requests from other users. Its features include status update, photo tagging and sharing, and more.\r\n\r\n\r\nFacebook’s profile structure includes a timeline, information related to the user, images of the user, images added by friends of the user, notes, pages, groups, and more. It enables its users to create pages related to entertainment, sports, business, finance, preferences, hobbies, culture, religion, causes, organizations, and a number of other categories. It also enables its users to join or create groups related to a vast number of categories.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith millions of more users, [Friendster](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/friendster) attempted to acquire the company for $10 million in mid-2004. Facebook turned down the offer and subsequently received $12.7 million in funding from [Accel Partners](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/accel-partners) at a valuation of around $100 million. Facebook continued to grow opening up to high school students in September 2005 and adding a photo sharing feature the next month. The next spring, Facebook received $25 million in funding from [Greylock Partners](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/greylock) and [Meritech Capital](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/meritech-capital-partners) as well as previous investors [Accel Partners](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/accel-partners) and [Peter Thiel](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/peter-thiel). The pre-money valuation for this deal was about $525 million. Facebook subsequently opened up to work networks eventually amassing over 20,000 work networks. Finally in September 2006, Facebook was opened to anyone with an email address.\r\n\r\n\r\nFacebook continued to receive funding most notably in January 2011 receiving $1.5 billion and valuing the company at $50 billion. A year later in February 2012, Facebook announced that it was filing for its long-anticipated initial public offering. The company went public on May 18, 2012 opening in [NASDAQ](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nasdaq-private-market) with shares trading at $42.05.\r\n\r\n\r\nFacebook announced positive numbers in February 2012 upon filing for its IPO. As of July 2013 over 1.15 billion users have logged into Facebook every month and 669 million users daily. Mobile users now make up half of Facebook’s user base with 819 million monthly actives. Facebook is one of the most trafficked sites in the United States. Additionally, Facebook is the top photo sharing site with 250 million photos uploaded per day.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe company has strategic partnership with AXA Group to develop marketing and commercial collaboration in the digital, social, and mobile sphere.\r\n\r\n\r\nFacebook is currently the owner of many applications and services such as Pagemodo Pagebuilder, [RSS Graffiti](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/rss-graffiti), [Huddle](http://www.crunchbase.com/product/huddle), and more. It is the world’s largest social network with over 1.32 billion monthly active users.\r\n\r\n\r\nFacebook was founded by [Mark Zuckerberg](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/mark-zuckerberg), [Eduardo Saverin](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/eduardo-saverin), [Andrew McCollum](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/andrew-mccollum), [Dustin Moskovitz](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/dustin-moskovitz), and [Chris Hughes](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/chris-hughes) on February 4, 2004 in Menlo Park, California.",

                                    "description": "Facebook is an online social networking service that allows its users to connect with friends and family as well as make new connections. It provides its users with the ability to create a profile, update information, add images, send friend requests, and accept requests from other users. Its features include status update, photo tagging and sharing, and more.\r\n\r\n\r\nFacebook’s profile structure includes a timeline, information related to the user, images of the user, images added by friends of the user, notes, pages, groups, and more. It enables its users to create pages related to entertainment, sports, business, finance, preferences, hobbies, culture, religion, causes, organizations, and a number of other categories. It also enables its users to join or create groups related to a vast number of categories.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith millions of more users, [Friendster](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/friendster) attempted to acquire the company for $10 million in mid-2004. Facebook turned down the offer and subsequently received $12.7 million in funding from [Accel Partners](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/accel-partners) at a valuation of around $100 million. Facebook continued to grow opening up to high school students in September 2005 and adding a photo sharing feature the next month. The next spring, Facebook received $25 million in funding from [Greylock Partners](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/greylock) and [Meritech Capital](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/meritech-capital-partners) as well as previous investors [Accel Partners](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/accel-partners) and [Peter Thiel](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/peter-thiel). The pre-money valuation for this deal was about $525 million. Facebook subsequently opened up to work networks eventually amassing over 20,000 work networks. Finally in September 2006, Facebook was opened to anyone with an email address.\r\n\r\n\r\nFacebook continued to receive funding most notably in January 2011 receiving $1.5 billion and valuing the company at $50 billion. A year later in February 2012, Facebook announced that it was filing for its long-anticipated initial public offering. The company went public on May 18, 2012 opening in [NASDAQ](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nasdaq-private-market) with shares trading at $42.05.\r\n\r\n\r\nFacebook announced positive numbers in February 2012 upon filing for its IPO. As of July 2013 over 1.15 billion users have logged into Facebook every month and 669 million users daily. Mobile users now make up half of Facebook’s user base with 819 million monthly actives. Facebook is one of the most trafficked sites in the United States. Additionally, Facebook is the top photo sharing site with 250 million photos uploaded per day.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe company has strategic partnership with AXA Group to develop marketing and commercial collaboration in the digital, social, and mobile sphere.\r\n\r\n\r\nFacebook is currently the owner of many applications and services such as Pagemodo Pagebuilder, [RSS Graffiti](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/rss-graffiti), [Huddle](http://www.crunchbase.com/product/huddle), and more. It is the world’s largest social network with over 1.32 billion monthly active users.\r\n\r\n\r\nFacebook was founded by [Mark Zuckerberg](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/mark-zuckerberg), [Eduardo Saverin](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/eduardo-saverin), [Andrew McCollum](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/andrew-mccollum), [Dustin Moskovitz](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/dustin-moskovitz), and [Chris Hughes](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/chris-hughes) on February 4, 2004 in Menlo Park, California.",

                                    "description": "Facebook is an online social networking service that allows its users to connect with friends and family as well as make new connections. It provides its users with the ability to create a profile, update information, add images, send friend requests, and accept requests from other users. Its features include status update, photo tagging and sharing, and more.\r\n\r\n\r\nFacebook’s profile structure includes a timeline, information related to the user, images of the user, images added by friends of the user, notes, pages, groups, and more. It enables its users to create pages related to entertainment, sports, business, finance, preferences, hobbies, culture, religion, causes, organizations, and a number of other categories. It also enables its users to join or create groups related to a vast number of categories.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith millions of more users, [Friendster](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/friendster) attempted to acquire the company for $10 million in mid-2004. Facebook turned down the offer and subsequently received $12.7 million in funding from [Accel Partners](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/accel-partners) at a valuation of around $100 million. Facebook continued to grow opening up to high school students in September 2005 and adding a photo sharing feature the next month. The next spring, Facebook received $25 million in funding from [Greylock Partners](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/greylock) and [Meritech Capital](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/meritech-capital-partners) as well as previous investors [Accel Partners](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/accel-partners) and [Peter Thiel](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/peter-thiel). The pre-money valuation for this deal was about $525 million. Facebook subsequently opened up to work networks eventually amassing over 20,000 work networks. Finally in September 2006, Facebook was opened to anyone with an email address.\r\n\r\n\r\nFacebook continued to receive funding most notably in January 2011 receiving $1.5 billion and valuing the company at $50 billion. A year later in February 2012, Facebook announced that it was filing for its long-anticipated initial public offering. The company went public on May 18, 2012 opening in [NASDAQ](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nasdaq-private-market) with shares trading at $42.05.\r\n\r\n\r\nFacebook announced positive numbers in February 2012 upon filing for its IPO. As of July 2013 over 1.15 billion users have logged into Facebook every month and 669 million users daily. Mobile users now make up half of Facebook’s user base with 819 million monthly actives. Facebook is one of the most trafficked sites in the United States. Additionally, Facebook is the top photo sharing site with 250 million photos uploaded per day.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe company has strategic partnership with AXA Group to develop marketing and commercial collaboration in the digital, social, and mobile sphere.\r\n\r\n\r\nFacebook is currently the owner of many applications and services such as Pagemodo Pagebuilder, [RSS Graffiti](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/rss-graffiti), [Huddle](http://www.crunchbase.com/product/huddle), and more. It is the world’s largest social network with over 1.32 billion monthly active users.\r\n\r\n\r\nFacebook was founded by [Mark Zuckerberg](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/mark-zuckerberg), [Eduardo Saverin](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/eduardo-saverin), [Andrew McCollum](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/andrew-mccollum), [Dustin Moskovitz](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/dustin-moskovitz), and [Chris Hughes](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/chris-hughes) on February 4, 2004 in Menlo Park, California.",
